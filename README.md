## **Mining Patterns from Large-Scale Flight Data:**<br>**Feature Engineering and Classification for Delay Prediction at ATL**

## Abstract 

Flight operations generate massive volumes of data containing valuable patterns for predicting delays and optimizing operations. This paper presents a comprehensive data mining approach for extracting knowledge from large-scale flight records to predict arrival delays. Working with over 4 million flight records from 2022, we develop a systematic methodology encompassing data cleaning, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and classification. We focus on flights from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, applying three classification algorithms to the processed data. Our analysis reveals that cyclical encoding of temporal features and careful handling of class imbalance are critical for achieving high prediction accuracy. The Random Forest classifier achieves 96.31% accuracy on 179,852 flight records, correctly identifying 89% of delayed flights. We provide detailed insights into data preprocessing pipelines, feature importance patterns, and the impact of various preprocessing decisions on model performance. Our findings demonstrate that systematic data mining workflows can extract actionable knowledge from complex aviation datasets to support operational decision-making.
