\section*{Abstract}
Flight delays impose significant costs on airlines and inconvenience passengers.  
In recent years, numerous studies have employed machine learning techniques—such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and deep neural networks—for flight delay prediction. For instance, Hatıpoğlu \textit{et al.} applied a range of ML models, including XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM, along with SMOTE and SHAP for handling class imbalance and feature interpretation, achieving around 80\% accuracy for delays exceeding 15 minutes \cite{Hatipoglu2024}. Similarly, Li \textit{et al.} introduced a priority-aware random forest that weighs weather and non-weather features, demonstrating improved accuracy on U.S. domestic flight data \cite{Li2023}.  

Building on these findings, this proposal introduces a lightweight, interpretable machine learning model—starting with Random Forest—for predicting flight delays using publicly available historical flight and weather data. A simple web-based visualization dashboard will display delay risks per route and airport in intuitive formats (e.g., heatmaps, bar charts).  

Future work is planned on a biweekly timeline:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Weeks 1--2 — data collection and preprocessing
    \item Weeks 3--4 — model development and baseline evaluation
    \item Weeks 5--6 — dashboard implementation and result visualization
    \item Weeks 7--8 — validation, presentation preparation, and final report drafting
\end{itemize}
